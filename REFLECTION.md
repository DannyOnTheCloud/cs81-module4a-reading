What was the most helpful aspect of this codeâ€™s structure? 
- The most helpful aspect of this code is the easy function names and beginner friendly loops that involved adding entries and starting at one and adding plus one to entries that
- have already existed. I found this insightful as to understand the 'math' logic behind the whole ordeal. 

What part was confusing or took longer to understand?

In my opinion the most confusing part was how the syntax worked in particularly involving brackets, braces, and paranthesis. How easily one could break the code is understandable
but rather the logic behind their structure/syntax tricked me for a bit as I thought that was something most people could understand at first glance.
